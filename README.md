## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I created a ToDo List for children to learn how to work with React, and for my child to use this application.

* The project is implemented based on React.
* Cute design for children and friendly interface.
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
